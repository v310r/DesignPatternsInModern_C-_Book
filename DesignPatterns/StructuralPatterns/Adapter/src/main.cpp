// Adapter is a very simple concept: it allows you to adapt the interface you
// have to the interface you need.The only real issue with adapters is that, in
// the process of adaptation, you sometimes end up generating temporary
// data so as to satisfy some other representation of data.And when this
// happens, turn to caching : ensuring that new data is only generated when
// necessary.Oh, and you’ll need to do a bit more work if you want to clean
// up stale data when the cached objects have changed.
// Another concern that we haven’t really addressed is laziness : the
// current adapter implementation performs the conversion as soon as it
// is created.What if you only want the work to be done when the adapter
// is actually used ? This is rather easy to do and is left as an exercise for the
// reader
