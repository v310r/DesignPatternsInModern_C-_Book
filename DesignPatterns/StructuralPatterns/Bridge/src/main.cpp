// The Bridge is a rather simple concept, serving as a connector or glue,
// connecting two pieces together.The use of abstraction(interfaces) allows
// components to interact with one another without really being aware of the
// concrete implementations.
// That said, the participants of the Bridge pattern do need to be aware
// of each other’s existence.Specifically, a Circle needs a reference to the
// Renderer and, conversely, the Renderer knows how to specifically draw
// circles(thus, the name of the draw_circle() member function).This
// can be contrasted with the Mediator pattern, which allows objects to
// communicate without being directly aware of each other.
